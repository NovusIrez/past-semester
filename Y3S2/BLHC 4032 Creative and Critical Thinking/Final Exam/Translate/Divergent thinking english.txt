When we have generated as many ideas as possible through divergent thinking, we need to select the best of these and assess their potential value. This requires convergent thinking, whereby we make deliberate and conscious choices. We purposefully apply appropriate criteria to screen, select, evaluate, and refine the options, while recognising that the ideas will still require further development. Criteria to judge potential solutions might include considerations such as budget and timing for example.


Go through the all the ideas and select all the ideas that broadly fit within your criteria. Take time to deliberate over your decision-making. Avoid snap decisions or harsh judgments. Give every option a fair chance. Combine related ideas as appropriate. Then go through each idea more carefully. Think about how ideas can be improved to best solve your problem and meet your criteria. Consider novel and original ideas and ways that these might be improved and tailored.
Refine and improve your ideas, and select those that provide the best fit to address your challenge. Draw up an action plan identifying the steps you need to take to implement your ideas. Break these down into a series of tasks to keep them manageable. And now youâ€™re ready to tackle your challenge.
