Ali has just bought a new cellular smartphone from Samsung shop at Melaka city Jusco. Based on the technical specifications provided by the user manual, the battery capacity
of the smartphone is stated as 4040 mAH. It is also mentioned that the smartphone draws
100 mA during a call and 10 mA in idle mode. Analyse the battery life performance if
Ali makes a 12-minute call and then leaves the phone on continuously everyday. What
happens if he does the same thing for every hour? Predict the maximum talk time
available for the cellular smartphone.
