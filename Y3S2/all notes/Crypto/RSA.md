RSA encryption is a public-key cryptography system that is widely used for secure data transmission.

he basic idea of RSA encryption is as follows:

1.  Key Generation: The first step is to generate a pair of keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt messages, while the private key is used to decrypt messages.

2.  Encryption: To encrypt a message, the sender obtains the recipient's public key and uses it to encrypt the message. The encrypted message can then be sent to the recipient over an insecure channel, such as the internet.
 
3.  Decryption: To decrypt the message, the recipient uses their private key to decrypt the encrypted message. The decrypted message is then readable by the recipient.

The security of RSA encryption is based on the mathematical problem of factoring large numbers, which is considered to be computationally infeasible for large values of the encryption key. As a result, RSA encryption is widely used for secure communication, digital signatures, and other applications that require secure data transmission.

The most difficult, intractable problem in RSA is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">factorization of a large composite number into its prime factors</mark>. Given a public key (n, e), finding the private key (d, n) requires <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">factoring the large composite number n</mark> into its prime factors, which is considered to be a computationally hard problem. This difficulty forms the basis of the security of RSA encryption.
