The most difficult, intractable problem in cryptography in general is the problem of finding the secret key in a cryptographic system. This can take many forms, such as:

- Integer Factorization: finding the prime factors of a large composite number, as in RSA
- Discrete Logarithm: finding an integer k such that kP = Q, as in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- The shortest vector problem (SVP) in lattices
- Cipher Block
- Non-linear Equation
- The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem

These problems form the basis of the security of many cryptographic systems, as solving them would allow an attacker to determine the secret key and defeat the security of the system.
