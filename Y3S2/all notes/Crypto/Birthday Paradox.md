1. Birthday Paradox with 15 to 30 people: In the birthday paradox, the probability that two or more people in a group have the same birthday becomes significant as the size of the group increases. With a group of 15 to 30 people, the probability of two people having the same birthday is approximately 44% to 97%. This means that in a group of 15 to 30 people, it's highly likely that at least two people will have the same birthday.

2. Explanation of the Birthday Paradox with 15 to 30 people: The birthday paradox is a well-known statistical phenomenon that demonstrates how seemingly unlikely events can become more probable as the size of a sample grows. The paradox states that even though there are 365 possible birthdays in a year, the probability of two people in a group having the same birthday becomes significant as the group size increases. In a group of 15 to 30 people, the probability of two people having the same birthday is quite high, which is counter-intuitive to many people. This is because the number of possible pairs of people in a group grows much faster than the number of people in the group.
