#### Provide your views on Malaysia's need for its own privacy law
Does malaysia in need of privacy law?

##### The Personal Data Protection Act 2010
The PDPA basically provides provisions that regulates how personal data can be collected, processed and used when it comes to dealing with personal data of their employees, suppliers, and customers.  As such, the PDPA regulates data privacy and data protection.

##### Malaysia has no specific Privacy Law
Unlike other jurisdictions, Malaysia has no specific law such as a Privacy Act to protect personal privacy, except for the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (“PDPA”), which deals with personal data and focuses on regulating the processing of ‘personal data’ in commercial transactions

##### The Federal Constitution Does Not Specifically Provide a Right to Privacy
Unlike other jurisdictions where the fundamental right to privacy is specifically laid out and provided for in its constitution, the Malaysian Federal Constitution does not specifically stipulate that a person has a right to privacy

To date, there is no statutory enacted law that guarantees a Malaysian citizen of his privacy not to be invaded, save for the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (“PDPA”), which deals specifically with personal data rather than “privacy” itself

##### Personal Data is not the same as Privacy
It is a common misconception that the PDPA is a “privacy rights” legislation. While privacy and personal data can often be interlinked, the PDPA is narrow in its application as it deals with personal data privacy as opposed to privacy rights in general.  In contrast, the right to privacy relates to the right to be left alone and live free from intrusions by others

##### Privacy as a Right
Privacy is a fundamental human right recognized in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights and in many other international and regional treaties. Privacy underpins human dignity and other key values such as freedom of association and freedom of speech
