Spider-Man: No Way Home

Peter Parker, MJ and Ned

Continuing from the previous movie Far From Home, Peter has his identity as Spider-Man revealed and framed as murderer of Quentin. This gave Spider-Man bad publicity as Peter and his friends tries to live by Peter's identity as Spiderman. After being rejected from MIT, Peter seeks out Stephen Strange for help to cast a spell to make everyone forget about him as Spiderman but the spell was interrupted. After a series of events to contain the damage that he caused Peter realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory. At the end of the movie he was seen to continue his vigilantism as Spiderman.

If you have watched the previous Spiderman Marvel movies I'd really recommend to give No Way Home a watch. The actions and Peter's growth as a young superhero is a treat to watch and as a long time fan of Spiderman they even slide in some fanservice without ruining the quality. My only complaint is that Peter already learned in previous movies that his role as a superhero means that his actions have big consequence but overall it is a very enjoyable movie.
