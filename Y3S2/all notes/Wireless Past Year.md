The cell coverage radius for AMPS can be affected by <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">system loading</mark>, as an <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">increase in the number of active users</mark> in a cell can lead to a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">decrease in signal strength</mark> and a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">reduction in the coverage radius</mark>.

(ii) **North American CDMA System (IS-95)**: CDMA is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">digital cellular technology</mark> that uses <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">spread spectrum techniques</mark> to allow multiple users to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">share the same frequency band</mark>. The cell coverage radius for IS-95 can be affected by <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">system loading</mark>, as an <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">increase in the number of active users</mark> can lead to an <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">increase in interference</mark>, which can <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">decrease signal strength</mark> and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">reduce the coverage radius</mark>.

## Question 2

a) **Interference** is the limiting factor in performance of all cellular radio systems. List TWO major **types of system-generated cellular interference**, and propose the techniques to reduce the mentioned interference.

1. **Co-channel interference**: This type of interference occurs when <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">two or more cells are using the same frequency channel at the same time</mark>. This can lead to signal degradation and reduced capacity.

Techniques to reduce co-channel interference include:

-  **Frequency reuse**: By <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">using different frequency channels in different cells</mark>, the likelihood of co-channel interference is reduced.
-  **Power control**: By <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">adjusting the transmission power of the base station</mark>, the signal strength in a particular cell can be controlled, reducing the likelihood of co-channel interference.

2. **Adjacent channel interference**: This type of interference occurs when <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a signal on an adjacent channel interferes with the desired signal</mark>. This can lead to increased noise and reduced signal quality.

Techniques to reduce adjacent channel interference include:

-  **Using wider channel bandwidths**: By using wider channel bandwidths, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved and the likelihood of adjacent channel interference is reduced.
-  **Using filtering techniques**: By using filtering techniques such as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">filtering at the receiver</mark>, the interference from adjacent channels can be reduced.

## Question 3

a) Explain physical factors in a radio propagation channel that influence small-scale fading.

**Small-scale fading** refers to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rapid changes in the amplitude and phase of a radio signal</mark> as it propagates through a radio propagation channel. There are several physical factors that can influence small-scale fading in a radio propagation channel:

1.  **Multipath**: Multipath occurs when a radio signal reaches the receiver via multiple paths, such as **reflections** off of buildings or other objects. This can lead to constructive and destructive interference, causing rapid changes in the amplitude and phase of the signal, known as **multipath fading**.

2.  **Shadowing**: Shadowing occurs when a radio signal is blocked by an obstacle, such as a building or a hill. This can lead to rapid changes in the signal strength as the mobile device moves in and out of the shadowed area.

3.  **Scattering**: Scattering occurs when a radio signal is scattered by small objects, such as trees or other vegetation. This can lead to rapid changes in the signal strength and phase as the mobile device moves through an area with a high density of small objects.

4.  **Diffraction**: Diffraction occurs when a radio signal bends around an obstacle, such as a building. This can lead to rapid changes in the signal strength and phase as the mobile device moves around the obstacle.

5.  **Mobility**: The movement of the mobile device can also cause small-scale fading, as the device moves in and out of areas with different signal strengths and multipath conditions.

These factors can lead to small-scale fading that can <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">affect the quality of the radio signal </mark>and <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">reduce the capacity of the radio channel</mark>. Some techniques like <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">spatial filtering</mark>, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">beamforming</mark> and<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> smart antenna</mark> can be used to mitigate these effects.

## Question 4

**LTE** and **HSPA/HSPA+** are both <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cellular technologies</mark> that are widely used for mobile data communication. Both technologies offer several benefits, but there are also some key differences between them.

Benefits of LTE:

-   **High data rates**: LTE can provide data rates of up to 100 Mbps for downlink and 50 Mbps for uplink, which is much faster than HSPA/HSPA+.

-   **Low latency**: LTE has lower latency than HSPA/HSPA+, which means that data can be transmitted and received more quickly.

-   **Improved capacity**: LTE uses a more efficient spectrum utilization and advanced multiplexing techniques to support more users in a given area than HSPA/HSPA+.

Benefits of HSPA/HSPA+:

-   **Wider coverage**: HSPA/HSPA+ has a wider coverage than LTE, which means that it is more widely available in rural areas or remote locations.

-   **Backwards compatibility**: HSPA/HSPA+ is backwards compatible with existing GSM and GPRS networks, which allows it to be more easily deployed as an upgrade to existing networks.

-   **Lower cost**: HSPA/HSPA+ is generally less expensive to deploy than LTE, as it requires less infrastructure and fewer base stations.

In summary, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">LTE offers higher data rates, lower latency and improved capacity</mark>, while <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">HSPA/HSPA+ offers wider coverage, backwards compatibility and lower cost</mark>. It depends on the specific needs of the network and the area to be covered, but in general LTE is more suitable for higher data rate applications and high density areas, while HSPA/HSPA+ is more suitable for lower data rate applications and areas with lower population density.

## Question 2

### a)
a) A cellular design eventually becomes insufficient to support the growing number of users. With the aid of an appropriate diagram, propose and analyse ONE (1) **technique for improving the coverage and capacity in the cellular systems**.

**Small cells** are low-powered base stations that are designed to provide coverage and capacity in specific, targeted areas. They are typically smaller than traditional macro cells, and can be deployed in a variety of environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces.

Small cells can be used to improve coverage and capacity in cellular systems in several ways:

-   **Improved capacity**: Small cells have a smaller coverage area than macro cells, which means that more cells can be deployed in a given area. This increases the overall capacity of the network, allowing more users to access the network simultaneously.

-   **Improved coverage**: Small cells can be deployed in areas where traditional macro cells are unable to provide coverage, such as in buildings or other areas with poor signal penetration. This can help to improve the overall coverage of the network.

-   **Reduced interference**: Small cells operate on lower power levels than macro cells, which means that they generate less interference. This can help to improve the overall performance of the network.

-   **Cost-effective**: Small cells are typically less expensive to deploy than macro cells, as they require less infrastructure and fewer base stations. This can help to lower the overall cost of deploying and maintaining a cellular network.

-   **Flexible**: Small cells can be easily installed and uninstalled, which allows for greater flexibility in terms of deployment and network management.

There are several **other ways to improve coverage and capacity in cellular systems**, some of which include:

1.  **Frequency reuse**: By using different frequency channels in different cells, the likelihood of co-channel interference is reduced and the overall capacity of the network is increased.

2.  **Interference coordination**: By coordinating the transmission of different cells, the amount of interference in the network can be reduced, which improves the overall capacity of the network.

3.  **Smart antenna**: By using smart antenna technology, the signal strength and directionality of the antenna can be adjusted based on the location of the mobile device, which can improve the capacity and coverage of the network.

4.  **Beamforming**: By using beamforming technology, the directionality of the signal can be adjusted to focus the signal in a specific direction, which can improve the capacity and coverage of the network.

5.  **Self-organizing networks (SON)**: By using self-organizing networks, the network can optimize and configure itself automatically, which can improve the capacity and coverage of the network.

6.  **Heterogeneous networks (HetNet)**: By integrating different types of cells, such as macro cells and pico cells, the capacity and coverage of the network can be improved.

7.  **Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP)**: By coordinating the transmission of multiple base stations, the capacity and coverage of the network can be improved.

## Question 4

### a)
a) Classify THREE (3) types of multiple access techniques and compare the basic principle for each techniques.

There are several types of multiple access techniques that can be used in wireless communication systems to allow multiple users to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">share the same frequency band</mark>. Here are three common types of multiple access techniques, and a brief explanation of the basic principle for each:

1. **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)**: This is a multiple access technique where different frequency channels are assigned to different users. Each user is allocated a unique frequency band, and the users do not interfere with each other because they are using different frequency channels. The basic principle of FDMA is that it separates users by frequency, allowing them to communicate simultaneously without interfering with each other.

2. **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)**: This is a multiple access technique where different time slots are assigned to different users. Each user is allocated a unique time slot, and the users do not interfere with each other because they are transmitting and receiving at different times. The basic principle of TDMA is that it separates users by time, allowing them to communicate simultaneously without interfering with each other.

3. **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**: This is a multiple access technique where different codes are assigned to different users. Each user is allocated a unique code, and the users do not interfere with each other because they are using different codes. The basic principle of CDMA is that it separates users by code, allowing them to communicate simultaneously without interfering with each other.
