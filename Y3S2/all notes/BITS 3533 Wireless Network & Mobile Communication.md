> Transfer connection to another base station while in call

- Wifi under organization IEEE

Signal / Noise ratio (SNR)
- SNR up -> Performance up
- SNR down -> Performance down


Uplink (mobile to base station) -> LTE - FDMA
Downlink (base station to mobile) -> OFDMA
Hotspot - LTE tukar -> 3E Wifi

| Satellite orbits | Proximity to earth            | Signal Strength | Delay           | Coverage                   |  
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | 
| LEO              | 500km - 1500km                | Best            | Lowest          | Smallest                   |  
| MEO              | 8000km - 18000km              | Weaker than LEO | Higher than LEO | Larger than LEO            |     
| GEO              | 35,863km (remain in position) | Weakest         | Highest         | Largest (almost 1/4 earth) |     

| Satellite orbits | Characteristics                                                        | Advantages                                                                                              | Disadvantages                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LEO              | - Don't stay in fixed location <br /> - Visible for 15 to 20 minutes   | - Better signal and less delay makes best point to point communication <br /> - Less waste of bandwidth | - Costly network of satellite                                                                                                               |
| MEO              | - Visible for 2 to 8 hours                                             | - Fewer satellites are needed in network                                                                | - Longer delay, weaker signal than LEO                                                                                                      |
| GEO              | - Remain in the same position <br /> - 24 hour view of particular area | - Ideal for broadcast and other multipoint applications                                                 | - Weak signal and high time delay <br /> - Centered above the equator satellites have difficulty broadcasting signals to near polar regions |
