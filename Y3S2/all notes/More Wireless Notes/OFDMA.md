**OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)** is a multiple access technique that is widely used in wireless communication systems, such as in WiMAX and 4G/LTE cellular networks. It is a combination of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and FDMA.

OFDMA <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">divides the available bandwidth into multiple subcarriers</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">each subcarrier is assigned to a different user</mark>. Each user is allocated a specific number of subcarriers, and the users do not interfere with each other because they are using different subcarriers. This allows multiple users to communicate simultaneously without interfering with each other.

OFDMA also allows for the dynamic allocation of subcarriers to different users based on their current channel conditions. This allows the network to adapt to the changing conditions of the wireless channel and optimize the performance of the network.

Additionally, OFDMA allows for the use of adaptive modulation and coding schemes (MCS), which can improve the performance of the network by adjusting the modulation and coding used for each user based on their current channel conditions.

In summary, OFDMA is a multiple access technique that uses a combination of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and FDMA to allow multiple users to share the same frequency band simultaneously without interfering with each other. It allows for dynamic allocation of subcarriers and adaptive modulation and coding schemes, which improves the performance of the network.
