Ali has just bought a new cellular smartphone from Samsung shop at Melaka city Jusco. Based on the technical specifications provided by the user manual, the battery capacity
of the smartphone is stated as **4040 mAH**. It is also mentioned that the smartphone draws **100 mA during a call** and **10 mA in idle mode**. Analyse the battery life performance if Ali **makes a 12-minute call and then leaves the phone on continuously everyday**. What happens if **he does the same thing for every hour**? Predict the **maximum talk time available** for the cellular smartphone.

mA x h = mAh

**During a call**, the phone consumes 100 mA of power. If Ali makes a 12-minute call, the power consumption would be 
(100 mA) * (12 minutes / 60 minutes) = 20 mAh.

**In idle mode**, the phone consumes 10 mA of power. If Ali leaves the phone on continuously every day, the power consumption would be 
(10 mA) * (24 hours) = 240 mAh.

So, the **total power consumption per day** would be 
20 mAh + 240 mAh = 260 mAh.

Therefore, the **battery life of the smartphone** would be 
4040 mAh / 260 mAh = 15.5 days.

If Ali makes **the same call every hour**, the power consumption would be 
20 mAh x 24 = 480 mAh

So, the **total power consumption per day** would be
480 mAh + 240 mAh idle = 720 mAh

Therefore, **the battery life of the smartphone** would be
4040 mAh / 720 mAh = 5.6 days
