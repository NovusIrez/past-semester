System loading refers to the amount of usage or activity that is occurring on a particular system or network at a given time. In the context of wireless communication technology, system loading refers to the **number of users that are actively using the network**, as well as **the amount of data that is being transmitted and received**.

When a wireless network has high system loading, it means that there are many users accessing the network at the same time, and the network is being heavily utilized. This can lead to increased interference and congestion, which can negatively impact the performance of the network. As a result, the signal strength can decrease and the coverage radius can be reduced.

In contrast, when a wireless network has low system loading, it means that there are fewer users accessing the network and the network is not being heavily utilized. This can lead to less interference and congestion, which can improve the performance of the network. As a result, the signal strength can increase and the coverage radius can be increased.

It is important to monitor system loading in order to ensure that a wireless network is operating efficiently and effectively.
