I am very interested in learning about other countries and their cultures. I am eager to expand
my knowledge and understanding of the world beyond my own experiences and perspectives by
reading news online and learning their histories, as well as their customs and ways of life.

I enjoy spending my free time by watching educational or essay youtube videos, reading
fictional stories and playing role-playing games

The best way for me to improve my english is by chatting with my native english
speaking friends online and reading many fictional and non-fictional books in 
my free time

If I could learn a new skill, I would love to learn how to cook. I have always been fascinated by the art of cooking and the many different flavors to create delicious dishes. I think that being able to cook would not only be enjoyable, but it would also be a practical and useful skill to have in my daily life.

There are both advantages and disadvantages to doing part-time jobs while studying at university. One advantage is that it can provide students with valuable work experience and help them to develop important skills that will be useful in their future careers. Additionally, part-time jobs can provide students with extra income to help cover the costs of tuition and other expenses. However, there are also potential drawbacks to working while studying. It can be challenging to balance the demands of a job with the demands of school, and students may find it difficult to find the time and energy to devote to their studies. In my opinion, whether or not university students should do part-time jobs while they are studying ultimately depends on their individual circumstances and priorities.
