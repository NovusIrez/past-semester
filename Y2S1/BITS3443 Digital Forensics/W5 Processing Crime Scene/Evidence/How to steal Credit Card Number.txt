How To Steal Credit Numbers 

Ok this information is about the same as how to steal passwords but its credit cards your stealing this time. 

First off aol has a passprogram that not only has to do with passwords but also credit card numbers off of aol billing.  So what you do is go to write email and put passprogram@aol in the send box.
 
Next- in the subject box put in h-kte-429-2391- so aol gets a message that will let you by the pass block. Next go to the first line (where you would write an email) and type your screen name and real-credit card number and the name on the credit card, so the reciever will read it an send it past thinking you are going into your billing account. 

Next- in the 2nd line put in a fake persons name like ,joe brown and that fake person would be likely to be in aol billing. If not try a different name. Next in the 3rd line put in nothing , just leave it blank 
and that is it in one day aol will send you the credit card number of whoever you wanted. It is even eaiser than stealing passwords.
