- can be combined
- provides enrich user experieces
- much harder to calibrate

Shareable
- more than one person to use
- allow multiple inputs
- must have larger space for everyone

Tangible
- sensor-based interaction, physical object coupled with digital representation
- eg magic cube

Augmented Reality
- virtual representations are superimposed on physical devices and objects
- eg Pokemon Go
- need to stand out but not distract

Wearables
- comfort, hygiene, ease of wear, usability

Robots and Drones
- controlled remotely

- communication between human brain waves and external devices
- eg Electro smthing smthing (EEG)

Smart
- having some intelligence and connected to the internet and other devices
- aware of what is happening around them and execute appropriate actions




Which interface to use?
- depends on task, users, context, cost, robustness and so on
