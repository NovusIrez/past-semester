What to design
- Interaction between human and computer/application/software
- A good application design
- Need to take note of 
- > who are the users (who is going to use the application)
- > what are the activities (how they are used)
- > where they are going to be used


Interaction design (ID)
- designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact
- the design of spaces for human-com interaction (where the are going to be used)

Goals of ID
- develop usable products
- involve user in the design process (what they are looking for)
eg. interactive, easy to use

ID
- wider
- concerned with theory, research and practice of design UX

HCI
- narrower focus
- concerned with design, evaluation and implementation of interactive comp systems for human

User Experience
- Central to ID
- how a product behaves & how its going to be used by people irl (real world)
- every product = user experience
- how people feel about a product (pleasure & satisfaction)
-> cannot design a sensual experience, only create design features that can evoke it
-> touch/look/interact provoke sensual & satisfying UX

Good design
- understandable (content, how to use)
- interesting (want to use)
- easy to use (easy to navigate)
- uniform look & feel (consistent)
