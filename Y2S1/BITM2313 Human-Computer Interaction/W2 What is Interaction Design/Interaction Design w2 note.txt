Design Principles

When designing for for UX?
- what to provide
- what to avoid at the interface
- how to improve design


- Visibility
users able to know (what to do next, what can be done)

- Feedback
sending back info (what action has been done, what has been accomplished)

- Constraints
determining ways of restricting kinds of UI that can take place at given moment
-> validation
-> prevent users of incorrect selections
-> prevent mistakes
example: if the item is not on stock, you cant put it in cart
	 only allow form to be filled after ticking "accept terms"

- Consistency
-> colours
-> font
-> design

- Affordances
give a clue
allow people to know how to use it
example: home icon is for going back to main menu

- Mapping
where the user are
