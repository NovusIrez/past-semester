Understanding & Conceptualizing Interaction
(concept model/design space)

 Problem Space
help design team to be able to conceptualize the design space

- how to identify problem?
-> assumption & claim
   view multiple perspectives on the problem space

- Assumptions vs Claim

-> Assumption
taking something for granted when it need further investigation

-> Claim
stating something to be true when it is still open to question
- must've support to the claim (....based on...)

===================================

Problem Space -> Conceptual Models

===================================

 Conceptual Models
->high level description of how a system is organized & operates
->abstraction outlining what people can do with a product

 
 Core componenets

- Metaphors & Analogies
-> How do you summarize your product
-> how to understand what a product is for & how to use it for an activity
-> Hill climbing (start teaching from the bottom and increasing the difficulty)
-> teach something unfamiliar with something familiar

- Concept

Interaction Types

- Instructing
- Manipulating
- Conversing
- Exploring


 Instructing
- users issue instructions to a system

 Manipulating
- interact with objects in virtual/physical space by manipulating them
- eg: open, close, place, zoom in/out, strecth, shrink

 Conversing
- users have a dialog with a system

 Exploring
- users move through a virtual environment/physical space

 Responding
- alerting user to something that it thinks is of interest
-> direct responding (alert/notification)/ indirect respond
